# Wade TodoMVC Example

> Wade is a fresh **client-side** web framework for [**Go**](http://golang.org), created to bring these together:
* The awesome convenience of client-side Web development with HTML data binding (think AngularJS)
* The Go platform. The true Go-style concurrency syntax. And the advantages of coding in a compiled programming language without having to sacrifice productivity.
* The awesome feeling of being able to use the same language for both client and server.
