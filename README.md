# Wade.Go
Wade.Go is an upcoming brand new way to develop web sites and applications.
It's a *client-centric* web development library, but *not* for Javascript!

Isomorphic Javascript is cool but what could be better than that? **Isomorphic Go**.
And with that, comes:
* Write ui/client once, in Go, render seemlessly on both client and server (no SEO problems).
* Pleasure: Modern React-like development model, in Go.
* Maintainability: No more maintainability headache like with Javascript, and we could *go easy* on tests.
It helps a ton to have a types and compiler, especially for large projects.

# Development Status
Development has been reset, we have more than 1 people now (for real) and we came up with great new ideas.
We get rid of the old code base and mechanisms, which still contain a lot of mediorce things
influenced by Wade.Go's Angular-ish root. The new model we proposed is **much** more robust, we are very excited.

It's going to take yet much longer to release, but we are thrilled to think that the released product will be
much more awesome. Our ambitious goal is to make the best thing ever for web development,
very difficult, but we're shooting for no less.

Hope you like the idea and also want that dream become reality.
