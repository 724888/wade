Wade has been completely revamped (it's like a total version 2 actually), it's now infinite times better than the "nearly released" version of July.

All the docs are completely outdated and there's no docs for now, but there's a demo at [http://github.com/phaikawl/wadereddi](wadereddi). You could check that out.

I'm trying to solve the last bits of concern before a real announcement.
Stay tuned, it could be available in 20 days or a month.
