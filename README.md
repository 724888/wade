====
The comprehensive client-side web framework for Go -> js.

*Brought to you with love and excitement...*
#A brand new way of developing
No it wasn't a typo, Wade is a fresh **client-side** web framework for [**Go**](http://golang.org), created to bring these together:
* The awesome convenience of client-side Web development with HTML data binding (think AngularJS)
* The Go platform. The true Go-style concurrency syntax. And the advantages of coding in a compiled programming language without having to sacrifice productivity.
* The awesome feeling of being able to use the same language for both client and server.

#####How is that even possible?  
Wade.go is compiled with [gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs), a Go -> Javascript transpiler. Gopherjs has evolved to become an awesome platform for writing client-side web application in Go. It provides strong, convenient Go-Javascript interoperability, compatibility with most of the Go standard library, and full goroutine support. However, there's no good existing web framework/wrapper for it yet, that's why Wade is created.

#Features
* Developed from wonderful ideas in existing Javascript libraries.
    * Data binding inspired by [Rivets.js](http://rivetsjs.com)'s awesome mechanism
    * Custom elements inspired by [Polymer](http://polymer-project.org), but much simpler
    * Convenient pages declaration inspired by [Pager.js](http://pagerjs.com)  
* Type safe, strict and defensive, designed for Go from the ground up, Wade takes full advantage of the type system

#Let's get started!
* Start here: [Wa.de.Go! The Tour](http://phaikawl.gitbooks.io/wa-de-go-the-tour/).
* [Concepts reference]() (Coming soon)
* [API reference](http://godoc.org/github.com/phaikawl/wade)
    * [Binders reference ](http://godoc.org/github.com/phaikawl/wade/bind)

#Is it ready?
**Yes** it's ready to be used! But **No** it's not yet ready for a public announcement, not well tested, still needs some feedbacks and refinements, a lot of stability problems may arise.  
Basically, "closed beta" for now.

#Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Wade is young, feedbacks are necessary, the core functionalities are there but lot of things could be developed, like a (separate) package for authorization, websocket integration, etc...
