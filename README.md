Wade has been completely revamped (it's like a total version 2 actually), it's now infinite times better than the "nearly released" version of July.

All the docs are completely outdated and there's no docs for now, but there's a demo at [http://github.com/phaikawl/wadereddi](http://github.com/phaikawl/wadereddi). You could check that out.

UPDATE: I've discovered new great ideas that could improve the framework drastically and found some flaws that better be addressed before the realease. Basically I decide to develop a 3rd iteration of Wade.Go. Again, it will take a while.
