====
The comprehensive client-side web framework for Go -> js.

**Work-in-progress.**

*Brought to you with love and excitement...*
#A brand new way of developing
No it wasn't a typo, Wade is a fresh **client-side** web framework for [**Go**](http://golang.org), created to bring these together:
* The awesome convenience of client-side Web development with HTML data binding (think AngularJS)
* The Go platform. The true Go-style concurrency syntax. And the advantages of coding in a compiled programming language without having to sacrifice productivity.
* The awesome feeling of being able to use the same language for both client and server.

#####How is that even possible?  
Wade.go is compiled with [gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs), a Go -> Javascript transpiler. Gopherjs has evolved to become an awesome platform for writing client-side web application in Go. It provides strong, convenient Go-Javascript interoperability, compatibility with most of the Go standard library, and full goroutine support. However, there's no good existing web framework/wrapper for it yet, that's why Wade is created.

#Features
* Developed from wonderful ideas in existing Javascript libraries.
    * Data binding inspired by [Rivets.js](http://rivetsjs.com)'s awesome mechanism
    * Custom elements inspired by [Polymer](http://polymer-project.org), but much simpler
    * Convenient pages declaration inspired by [Pager.js](http://pagerjs.com)  
* Type safe, strict and defensive, designed for Go from the ground up, Wade takes full advantage of the type system

#Markup overview
Below are examples to show how working with HTML in Wade.go looks like.

An example Register page:

    <wpage pid="pg-user-register" route="/user/register" title="Register">
    
		Username:
		<input type="text" bind-value="Data.Username"></input>
		<errorlist bind="Errors: Errors.Username"></errorlist>
		
		Password:
		<input type="password" bind-value="Data.Password"></input>
		<errorlist bind="Errors: Errors.Password"></errorlist>
		
		<button bind-on-click="Reset">Reset</button>
		<button bind-on-click="Submit">Submit</button>
		
	</wpage>

That's how we create `<input>` fields with all the data automatically updated for `Username` and `Password`.

A method named `Reset` is called when the Reset button is clicked, similarly for Submit.

The `errorlist` above is a custom element, which is declared as

    <welement id="t-errorlist" attributes="Errors">
        <div class="error">
    		<ul>
    			<li bind-each="Errors -> key, error">
    				error type #<% key %>
    				<% error %>
    			</li>
    		</ul>
    	</div>
    </welement>

In the form, `Errors.Username` is a list of validation errors for the Username field. You can see that we can comfortably bind `errorlist`'s Errors attribute to a whole list that is `Errors.Username`, or `Errors.Password`. The elements inside have access to the list via `Errors`, we use a simple `bind-each` to loop through each error and display a list to the user.

Does it look good to you? So...

#Let's get started!
* Quick introduction: [Wa.de.Go! The Tour](http://phaikawl.gitbooks.io/wa-de-go-the-tour/).
* [Concepts reference]() (Coming soon)

#Is it ready?
Core functionalities are there, but there are still a lot of issues to be solved. So status changed to **WIP**.

#Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Wade is young, feedbacks are necessary, the core functionalities are there but lot of things could be developed, like a (separate) package for authorization, websocket integration, etc...
